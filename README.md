# lovelace-dashboard

Below is a list of all the custom components used in my dashboard.

NOTE: There are conditions for some cards (colours/icons) which are unused as they have been replaces with picture icons. 
I have left the code for this in as the pictures will not be to everyones taste.

I have also used the template function of Mushroom badges to show motion in rooms through badges.
